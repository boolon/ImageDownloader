This jupyter attends to download all the Magic The Gathering illustrations it can get from https://magicthegathering.io/, and all the Imaginary NetworkÂ illustrations it can get from the https://reddit.com. These two database have a non-null intersection.

Images are croped, downgraded and saved to account for the limitation in the Google Drive cloud in term of space and computation power.

Main objectives is to use these pictures for GAN strategies. Here is a disorganized list of (sometimes) relevant paper for ulterior applications.
